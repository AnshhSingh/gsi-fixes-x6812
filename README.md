# Gsi-fixes 
This repository is a magisk module to fix some problems with GSI for users facing speaker problems with dual speaker and call volume

Tested on infinix hot 11s it may or may not work on similar mediatek devices(Qualcomm will bootloop)

Use it at your own risk even though the chances of bootloop are very low I can't guarantee it

## Current tweaks
+ Call volume
+ Speaker fix
+ Better memory management
+ Better stablity
